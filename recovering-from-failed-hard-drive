Recovering failed hard drive in Linux software RAID (md) array
==============================================================
* To replace a drive in the root array, do this:
  mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdf1
  mdadm /dev/md1 --fail /dev/sdf2
  mdadm /dev/md0 --remove /dev/sdf1
  mdadm /dev/md1 --remove /dev/sdf2

  # Power down the system and replace the drive. Run "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id" to
  # figure out the serial number of the drive that failed (e.g., which serial
  # number corresponds to /dev/sdf). For example,
  # /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST4000DM000-1F2168_S300HG8F corresponds to one of the 4
  # TB disks (hence the model "ST4000DM000") with serial number "S300HG8F". The
  # serial number is printed on the front of the drive -- you don't need to
  # remove the drives to check it. You do, however, need to remove the front
  # plastic panel on the case, as well as the metal cage covering the drives,
  # to see the fronts of the drives.

  # Power on the system.
  # Copy partition table
  sfdisk -d /dev/sde | sfdisk /dev/sdf
  # Install bootloader (which should be on all drives, so you can boot from any)
  grub-install /dev/sdf && update-grub
  # Add new drive to array.
  mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdf1
  mdadm /dev/md1 --add /dev/sdf2

  # Monitor rebuild process.
  mdadm --detail /dev/md0
  mdadm --detail /dev/md1

=========================================
Recovering failed hard drive in ZFS array
=========================================
* To replace a drive in the ZFS array, do this:
  # Use disk GUID noted from running "zdb". Using the GUID lets you take a disk
  # offline and replace it even if you've already removed it from the system
  # (or the drive is dead and no longer has a /dev entry), as per
  # http://askubuntu.com/a/305981.
  zpool offline banana 18351370981040380042

  # Power down the system and replace the drive. See my note above about
  # figuring out the serial number of the drive that failed.

  # Power on the system.
  # Add new drive to array. See note above about figuring out the serial number of the
  # proper drive to pull.
  zpool replace banana 18351370981040380042 /dev/disk/by-id/<new-disk>

  # "-o ashift=12" may not be needed -- I see differing information depending
  # on source. Regardless, I include it to ensure consistency with the ashift
  # vaulue used when the array was built, which is critical.
  # "-f" is needed to overcome "does not contain an EFI label but it may
  # contain partition" error
  zpool replace -o ashift=12 -f banana 18351370981040380042 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST4000DM000-1F2168_S300HG8F

  # Monitor rebuild ("resilver") process.
  zpool status
